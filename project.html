  <div class="title">
    <p>Specifically, comparing the health care system in the UK to selected European countries to decipher whether a larger GDP predicts a better health care system.</p>
    <p>There are different ways of measuring how good a health care system is. Obvious factors to consider include mortality rates, waiting times, accessibility and affordability. I will integrate the first two in my project alongside various health indicators. I have chosen to include life expectancy, obesity rates and access to contraception.</p>
    <p>For most of the charts the same eleven countries are used to maintain consistency. These countries have been selected due to  their differing characteristics such as population size, GDP and geographical location within Europe.</p>

  <!--Conclusions. Number of words: 229-->
  <div class="title">
  <p>To conclude, countries with higher GDP’s, such as the UK, have higher ratings of access to contraception, higher life expectancies at birth but also a larger prevalence of obesity in the population. The former two would suggest that the higher GDP indicates a better health system, while the latter, the opposite.</p>
    <p>Most of the eleven countries’ governments have consistently spent between 10 and 16 percent of their total expenditure on health. Poland has always spent less than this. It also has the lowest life expectancy out of the countries in 2020 (and throughout most of the years graphed). It also has a low rating of access to contraception: 35.1%. Whereas Germany spends more on health and has a higher life expectancy and better access to contraception. Germany also has a higher GDP. Comparing these two countries suggests that a higher GDP does in fact result in better health care. However, this cannot be concluded merely by comparing two countries.</p>
    <p>Overall, without increasing the size of this project to include more countries, or even undertaking it on a global scale, it is hard to determine whether GDP affects healthcare. However, the data I used does indicate that countries with higher GDPs (in Europe), have higher life expectancies. Furthermore, as GDP has increased in Europe since 1960, infant mortality rates have decreased which is a positive indication for health care quality.</p>
